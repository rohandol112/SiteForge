# Backend Management 

## Overview
A comprehensive project management system built with Express.js, featuring role-based authentication, PostgreSQL database integration, and various management services including visual builder and ERD schema management.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### Backend Components
- **Express Router**: Handles incoming API requests and routes them to appropriate handlers
- **Authentication System**: 
  - JWT-based user authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Permission checks middleware
- **Database**: 
  - PostgreSQL as primary database
  - Prisma ORM for database operations
- **Code Generation Service**:
  - Template-based generation
  - AI-powered generation capabilities
  - Automated code quality checks

### Project Management Features
- Visual Builder for project structure
- ERD Schema Management
- CRUD Operations Interface
- Developer Dashboard
- Product Comparison Tools

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v13 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-management-system.git
cd project-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configurations
```

4. Set up the database
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV="development"
```

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. Access the documentation at `/api-docs` when running the server.

### Key Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project details
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project

## Frontend Integration

The system includes setup configurations for frontend integration. Follow these steps to connect your frontend:

1. Configure CORS settings in `config/cors.js`
2. Set up API base URL in your frontend application
3. Implement JWT token management
4. Connect to WebSocket endpoints if real-time features are needed

## Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- Request rate limiting
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Error Handling

The system implements a centralized error handling mechanism with:
- Standard error responses
- Error logging
- Monitoring capabilities
- Custom error types for different scenarios

## Development

### Code Style
- ESLint configuration for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

1. Build the application
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start production server
```bash
npm start
```

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring tools
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Monitoring and Maintenance

The system includes:
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Database health checks
- API endpoint monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
