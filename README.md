# SiteForge: The Developer's Visual Website and Backend Ecosystem

## Project Overview
SiteForge is a comprehensive full-stack development acceleration platform that bridges the gap between visual design and professional development workflows. It offers a range of innovative features to help developers create, generate, and deploy web applications faster and more efficiently.

## Key Features
1. **Intelligent Project Architecture Generator**:
   - Automatically create entire project architectures with AI-guided recommendations
   - Generate project structure, recommended tech stack, initial configuration files, containerization support, and CI/CD pipeline templates
2. **Contextual Code Generation**:
   - Generate not just APIs, but contextual code snippets for frontend components, backend services, database migrations, and testing
   - Support multiple frameworks like React, Vue, Next.js, Express, and Django
3. **Advanced Collaboration Features**:
   - Real-time collaborative design environment
   - Version control integration with intelligent merge suggestions
   - Role-based access control for team projects
   - Automated documentation generation
4. **Performance and Security Optimization**:
   - Built-in performance profiling tools
   - Security vulnerability scanner
   - Automatic dependency updates
   - Compliance checklist generator
5. **Machine Learning-Powered Development Assistant**:
   - Predictive code completion
   - Design pattern recommendations
   - Best practices suggestions
   - Performance bottleneck identification

## Technical Differentiators
- Not just a no-code platform, but an "intelligent code acceleration" platform
- Generates production-ready, best-practice code
- Supports multiple programming paradigms
- Flexible and extensible architecture
